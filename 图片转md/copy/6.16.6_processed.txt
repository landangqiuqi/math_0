By linearity it follows that
$$
\Phi(f) = \int_X f g \, d\mu
$$
holds for every simple measurable $f$, and so also for every $f \in L^\infty(\mu)$ since every $f \in L^\infty(\mu)$ is a uniform limit of simple functions $f_i$. 

Note that the uniform convergence of $f_i$ to $f$ implies $\|f_i - f\|_p \to 0$, hence $\Phi(f_i) \to \Phi(f)$ as $i \to \infty$.
