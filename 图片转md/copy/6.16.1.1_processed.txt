### 6.16 Theorem 
Suppose $1 \leq p < \infty$, $\mu$ is a $\sigma$-finite positive measure on $X$, and $\Phi$ is a bounded linear functional on $L^{p}(\mu)$. Then there exists a unique $g \in L^{q}(\mu)$, where $q$ is the exponent conjugate to $p$, such that
$$
\Phi(f) = \int_{X} fg \, d\mu \qquad (f \in L^{p}(\mu)). \tag{1}
$$
Moreover, if $\Phi$ and $g$ are related as in (1), we have
$$
\|\Phi\| = \|g\|_{q}. \tag{2}
$$
In other words, $L^{q}(\mu)$ is isometrically isomorphic to the dual space of $L^{p}(\mu)$ under the stated conditions.

**Proof**  
The uniqueness of $g$ is clear: if both $g$ and $g'$ satisfy (1), then the integral of $g - g'$ over any measurable set $E$ of finite measure is $0$ (as seen by taking $\chi_{E}$ for $f$), and the $\sigma$-finiteness of $\mu$ implies $g - g' = 0$ a.e.  

Next, if (1) holds, HÃ¶lder's inequality implies
$$
\|\Phi\| \leq \|g\|_{q}. \tag{3}
$$
It remains to prove that such $g$ exists and that equality holds in (3). If $\|\Phi\| = 0$, (1) and (2) hold trivially with $g = 0$. Thus, assume $\|\Phi\| > 0$.  

We first consider the case $\mu(X) < \infty$.  
For any measurable set $E \subset X$, define
$$
\lambda(E) = \Phi(\chi_{E}).
$$
